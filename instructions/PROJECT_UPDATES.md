## Project Updates

- Added project entry for `Foundit` (Project 2) using `/images/foundit-cover.jpg` as the cover and `/images/foundit-photo.png` as the secondary hero image. Case study currently uses the default template and awaits detailed content.
- Updated `Foundit` problem statement to: "Students often lose personal items like IDs, headphones, and wallets, but the recovery process is slow and unorganized. Without a system, most reports go unanswered, and valuable time is wasted."
- Reordered the `Foundit` case study sections to Problem → Goals → Research & Design Process → Results & Impact and replaced the goals content with the Student/Campus Security lists from the reference mock (matching screenshot layout with two green subheadings).
- Cleared the Foundit research subtitle/copy and replaced it with: “With the tight hackathon timeline, I used a combination of an AI assisted research and real interviews to gather insights efficiently.”
- Added `/images/foundit-research.png` under the new research paragraph to visualize the AI tool vs. interview findings.
- Added supporting research paragraphs describing insights from the AI tool and campus security interviews beneath the Foundit research image.
- Replaced the first design block with a “Brand Identity Design” subheading and narrative about the Foundit brand direction.
- Embedded `/images/foundit-design.png` under the Brand Identity Design copy to showcase typography, color palette, and logo.
- Added “User Personas & User Flows” sub-section with supporting copy and bullets beneath the brand design assets.
- Added `/images/foundit-persona.png` after the user flow narrative to display the persona visuals.
- Added `/images/flow1.png` and `/images/flow2.png` under the personas to highlight security guard and student flow diagrams.
- Added “Wireframes” subsection describing the purpose of the low-fidelity drafts.
- Added “Admin” subheading followed by `/images/admin-wireframe.png` to show portal wireframes.
- Added “Student” subheading and `/images/student-wireframe.png` to capture the student app wireframes.
- Documented new AI assistance + testing paragraphs below the student wireframes.
- Trimmed remaining placeholder blocks from Foundit’s design section so it now ends before Results & Impact.
- Renamed Foundit’s “Results & Impact” section (and TOC entry) to “Final Solution”.
- Replaced Final Solution intro copy with launch summary and added “Key Improvements” bullet list, plus a deliverables subsection.
